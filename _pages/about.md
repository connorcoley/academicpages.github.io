If you'd like to collaborate, ask about my work, get a copy of a paper stuck behind a paywall, set up a consullting agreement, etc., send me an <a href="mailto:ccoley@mit.edu">email</a>. <br>

I will spend the upcoming year as a postdoctoral associate at the Broad Institute before beginning a position as an Assistant Professor at MIT in the Department of Chemical Engineering in 2020. 


Research Interests
======
I'm generally interested in questions of how data and automation can be used to streamline discovery in the chemical sciences. I've recently been focused on identifying questions in chemistry and cheminformatics that are answerable by the data we have access to; another equally important problem, however, is how to efficiently conduct experiments to gather the information we would need to answer currently-unanswerable questions. <br>

My future research will work toward a new paradigm of computational assistance for molecular discovery through an interdisciplinary approach combining chemistry, chemical engineering, and computer science in close partnership with experts in application domains such as chemical biology and human health.<br>

My PhD work was comprised of two parallel tracks: experimental and data-driven/computational. The former includes the actual construction, control, and use of automated microfluidic reactor platforms for screening and optimizing chemical reactions; the latter includes the development of a data-driven synthesis planning program and <em>in silico</em> strategies for predicting the outcomes of organic reactions. For this work, I was named a <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-graduate-student-connor-coley-named-darpa-riser-0716" target="_blank">DARPA Riser</a>, one of <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i33/Connor-Coley.html" target="_blank">C&amp;EN's Talented 12</a>, and one of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2019/healthcare/" target="_blank">Forbes 30 under 30: Healthcare</a>. One of the last products of my PhD was releasing the open source version of <a href="https://github.com/connorcoley/ASKCOS" target="_blank">ASKCOS</a>--a computer-aided synthesis planning program--which features heavily in our demonstration of AI-assisted robotic execution of flow reactions, written up in <i><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6453/eaax1566" target="_blank">Science</a></i>.<br> 


Other Interests
======
In my spare time, I like to cook, garden, hike, and practice Portuguese.

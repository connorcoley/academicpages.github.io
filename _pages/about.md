This is my (in progress) personal academic website! If you'd like to collaborate or have any questions about my work, grad school, etc., I'm very responsive to <a href="mailto:ccoley@mit.edu">email</a>.

Research Interests
======
I'm generally interested in questions of how data and automation can be used to streamline discovery in the chemical sciences. My PhD work is comprised of two parallel tracks: experimental and data-driven/computational. The former includes the actual construction, control, and use of automated microfluidic reactor platforms for screening and optimizing chemical reactions; the latter includes the development of a data-driven synthesis planning program and <em>in silico</em> strategies for predicting the outcomes of organic reactions.<br> 

I've recently been focused on identifying questions in chemistry and cheminformatics that are answerable by the data we have access to; another equally important problem, however, is how to efficiently conduct experiments to gather the information we would need to answer currently-unanswerable questions.<br>


Non-Research Interests
======
In my spare time, I like to cook, garden, and try to learn Portuguese.
